This is a personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features five interactive buttons (Profile, Education, Training, Projects, Contact) that show and hide sections dynamically using a simple JavaScript function.
The layout includes a background image, profile picture, and styled sections, all controlled with CSS. The site works as a single-page application, allowing smooth navigation without page reloads.
